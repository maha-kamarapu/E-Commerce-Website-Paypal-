# Comprehensive E-Commerce Website for Restaurants
This web application is a comprehensive solution for a restaurant, combining table reservations with an integrated e-commerce platform. Users can explore a detailed menu, add items to their cart, and complete secure payments via real-time PayPal integration. In addition to shopping, the platform enables customers to reserve tables by entering their preferences, such as the number of guests, date, and time, ensuring a seamless booking experience. With its user-friendly interface and responsive design, the application offers an engaging and efficient experience across all devices.

Built with modern web technologies, the system uses Node.js and Express.js for backend logic, routing, and API endpoints. MongoDB efficiently stores customer data, reservations, orders, and session details. The front-end is powered by EJS templates, creating dynamic and interactive views, while Bootstrap and custom CSS ensure a responsive design. jQuery and Nice Select enhance the user interface with features like improved dropdowns. PayPal integration provides secure and fast real-time payment processing, ensuring convenience and reliability.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB 
- NPM (Node Package Manager) 
- XAMPP Control Panel

  ## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/maha-kamarapu/E-Commerce-Website-Paypal-
```


2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```
cd E-Commerce Website(Paypal)
```

3. To install all required dependencies, run:

4. Install MongoDB Locally (if necessary):
   
If you donâ€™t have MongoDB installed locally and prefer not to use a cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), download and install MongoDB from the official MongoDB website.

After installation, start the MongoDB service: 
```
mongod
```
## Execution

1. Use the connection string for your MongoDB instance (local or MongoDB Atlas). Create a database in the MongoDB Atlas and paste it's name in the db.js and seed.js files in the following contexts:

 - db.js file: 
```

const mongoURI = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_database_name';

```
- seed.js file:
  
  ```
  mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_database_name',
  ```

2. The database can be seeded with products in two ways:
- Populate the MongoDB database with product data via the seeder script included in the files(/model/Product.js). Run the seeder script as follows:

```
node seed.js
```

- The products can be added directly in the Product section of the MongoDB database in the MongoDB Atlas.
